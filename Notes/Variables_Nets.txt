There are two main groups of data Objects, variables and nets, these two groups differ in the way 
in which they are assgined and hold values. 

Nets: 
- Can be written by one or more continous assignments, primitive outputs, or through module ports
- The Resultant value of multiple drivers is determined by the resolution function of the net type
- Cannot be procedurally assigned, if a net on one side of a port is driven by a variable on the other
    side, a continuous assignment is implied 
- A FORCE statement can override the value of a net when released the net returns to the resovled value

Variables:
-Written by one or more procedural statements, including prcedural continous assignments
    the last write determines the value. 
-Alternatively, variables can be written by one continous assignment or one port.
